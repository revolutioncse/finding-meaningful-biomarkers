# finding-meaningful-biomarkers

This was a project that I worked on as part of Machine Learning course that I took while pursuing Masters in Computer Science.
This project is to find meaningful biomarkers in prostate cancer. In order to increase the efficacy of the various ML algorithms, 
I tried lot of things like Feature Selection, Data Augmentation, PCA, Data visualization and more. You can find more details in the
report that is also present in this repository along with the code and all the experiments that I conducted.
